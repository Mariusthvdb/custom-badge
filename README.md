# custom-badge
Custom badge to replace the deprecated Badge in 2024.8

Still in a very very pre-aplha phase. Commented the import for the editor, which does not exist yet

```yaml
- title: Test
  path: test_1
  icon: mdi:test-tube
  badges:

      - type: custom:custom-badge
        entity: light.alarm
```
